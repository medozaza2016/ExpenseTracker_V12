/*
  # Fix user list RLS policies

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing policies
    - Create new policies that properly handle admin access
    - Fix recursive policy issues
    - Ensure admins can see all users
    - Ensure regular users can only see their own profile

  2. Security
    - Admins have full access to all profiles
    - Regular users can only read and update their own profile
    - No circular dependencies in policy definitions
