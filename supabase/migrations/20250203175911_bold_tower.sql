  # Update profile RLS policies

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing profile policies
    - Create new policies that properly handle admin access
    - Add policy for admin users to manage all profiles
  
  2. Security
    - Admins can read and manage all profiles
    - Regular users can only read and manage their own profiles
