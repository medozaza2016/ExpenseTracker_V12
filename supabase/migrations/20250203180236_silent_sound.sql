/*
  # Fix user policies to use auth.users

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing policies
    - Create new policies that use auth.users instead of profiles table
    - Fix permission denied errors
    - Ensure proper access control without circular dependencies

  2. Security
    - Admins can manage all profiles
    - Users can only manage their own profile
    - No direct access to auth.users table required
