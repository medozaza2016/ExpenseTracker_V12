/*
  # Fix profile RLS policies to avoid recursion

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing profile policies
    - Create new policies that avoid circular references
    - Use a simpler approach for admin access
  
  2. Security
    - Admins can read and manage all profiles
    - Regular users can only read and manage their own profiles
    - Avoid recursive policy checks
